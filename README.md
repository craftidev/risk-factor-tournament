## Rating
- Fetch rating on www.fide.com
- If more than G game the last Y years: make a weighted adjustement on performance
    - Re-do each round as we get results
    - Any game before 03/10/24 gets the rating adjustement to avoid confusion: if < 2000, New Rating = Old Rating + (0.40) × (2000 − Old Rating)

## Prediction
Use the elo prediction system, but adjust to real world experience where `(elo difference) x (.84)` makes a better predictor.

## Chances
Simulate the round robin tournament to get players chances to get the prizes

## Risk factor
